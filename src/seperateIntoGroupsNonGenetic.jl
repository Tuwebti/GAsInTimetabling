# Algorithm description. Start with a certain number n of groups and a set of students. The goal is to seperate the students into the n groups so as to minimize the maximum of the amount of modules in each group. (ie, if the set of groups is "Groups" we are trying to find min(max({|group_i| | group_i âˆˆ Groups}))).
# To do this, we first try to assign the n students that are the most different to each of the n different groups.
# We then iterate through the rest students, assigning them to the group_i such that |group_i union {student}| is minimal.

    students::Set{Student}
    events::Set{Event}
